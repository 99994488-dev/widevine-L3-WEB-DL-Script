# widevine-L3-WEB-DL-Script
This is a batch script created to WEB-DL.
Works well with .mpd files , for m3u8 please use n_m3u8 program (not included in this batch script).

** This is not the best way to do it but whatever. **

Note : You need Old Version of Chrome v87 or below.

You will need yt-dlp.exe , mp4decrypt.exe , mkvmerge.exe in the directory. 

If there are more decryption keys , edit the script like this.
